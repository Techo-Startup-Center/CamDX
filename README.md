CamDX is a unified yet decentralized data exchange layer between information systems that offers a standardized and secure way to provide and consume services. CamDX ensures confidentiality, integrity, and interoperability between a multitude of different data exchange parties.

CamDX is also founded on The Once-Only Principle (TOOP) concept which ensure that the data will be collected from citizen, business and government once adhering to data protection laws/regulations with user consent. The collected data will be shared among authorized institutions. By sharing the data among only authorized authorities, the TOOP reduces the administrative burden and improves data consistency.
